## CSS Syntax
A CSS rule is made up of a **selector** and a **declaration block**.
### CSS Selector
The selector targets the HTML element you wish to style.
### Declaration Block
The declaration block consists of one or more declarations, each separated by a semicolon.
Each declaration comprises a CSS property name and its corresponding value, separated by a colon.

Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons, and the entire declaration block is enclosed in curly braces.

### Example
The following code will center-align all `<p>` elements and set their text color to red:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Explanation of the Example
- `p` is the selector, targeting the `<p>` HTML element for styling.
- `color` is a CSS property with `red` as its value.
- `text-align` is a CSS property with `center` as its value.
