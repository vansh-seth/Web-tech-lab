# CSS Gradients

## Gradient Backgrounds

CSS gradients allow for smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. There are three types of gradients in CSS:

1. **Linear Gradients** (transition in a straight line)
2. **Radial Gradients** (radiate from the center)
3. **Conic Gradients** (rotate around a center point)

### CSS Linear Gradients

To create a linear gradient, define at least two color stops, which are the colors between which the transitions will occur. You can also set the gradient's starting point and direction (or angle).

#### Syntax
```css
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);
```

### Directions

#### Top to Bottom (default)
```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);
}
```

#### Left to Right
```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
}
```

#### Diagonal (Top Left to Bottom Right)
```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, yellow);
}
```

### Using Angles

For more control over the gradient direction, you can specify an angle. For example, `0deg` is equivalent to "to top", `90deg` is "to right", and `180deg` is "to bottom".

```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);
}
```

### Multiple Color Stops

You can add multiple color stops in a linear gradient.

```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow, green);
}
```

### Rainbow Background Example
```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet);
}
```

### Using Transparency

To add transparency, use the `rgba()` function for the color stops. The last parameter in `rgba()` defines transparency (0 for full transparency, 1 for full color).

```css
#grad {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,0,0,0), rgba(255,0,0,1));
}
```

### Repeating a Linear Gradient

Use the `repeating-linear-gradient()` function to create repeating linear gradients.

```css
#grad {
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);
}
```
