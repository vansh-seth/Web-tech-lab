# HTML Lists

HTML lists are used by web developers to group related items together.

## Unordered List
An unordered list starts with the `<ul>` tag. Each list item is denoted by the `<li>` tag. By default, list items are marked with bullets.

Example:
```html
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
```

## Ordered List
An ordered list starts with the `<ol>` tag. Each list item is denoted by the `<li>` tag. By default, list items are marked with numbers.

Example:
```html
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
```

## Description List
A description list consists of terms and their descriptions. It is defined using the `<dl>` tag, where terms are defined with `<dt>` and descriptions with `<dd>`.

Example:
```html
<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>
```
