# HTML Paragraphs and Formatting Elements
HTML paragraphs provide structure and readability to your content. Let's explore paragraphs, horizontal rules, line breaks, and preformatted text in HTML.
## HTML Paragraphs
The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph. It always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
### Example
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```
## HTML Display
HTML display can vary across different screen sizes and window resolutions. Extra spaces and lines in your HTML code are automatically removed by browsers.

### Example
```html
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser
ignores it.
</p>
```

## HTML Horizontal Rules

The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, usually displayed as a horizontal rule to separate content or define a change.

### Example
```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
```

## HTML Line Breaks

The `<br>` element defines a line break without starting a new paragraph.

### Example
```html
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```
