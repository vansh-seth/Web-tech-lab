# HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

`<h1>` defines the most important heading, while `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

### Example
```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

**Note:** Browsers automatically add some white space (margin) before and after a heading.

### Headings Are Important

Search engines use headings to index the structure and content of web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It's crucial to use headings to demonstrate the document structure.

`<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then `<h3>` for less important sections, and so forth.

**Note:** Use HTML headings for headings only. Avoid using headings to make text BIG or bold.

### Bigger Headings

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the `style` attribute using the CSS `font-size` property.

### Example
```html
<h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Heading 1</h1>
```

### HTML Exercises

Test Yourself With Exercises
