# HTML Computer Code Elements
## Overview
HTML provides several elements for defining user input and displaying computer code and its output. These elements are crucial for accurately representing code snippets, keyboard input, program output, and variables within HTML documents.
## HTML Elements for Computer Code
### `<code>` Element
The `<code>` element is used to define a piece of computer code. It displays content in the browser's default monospace font.
Example:
```html
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
```
### `<kbd>` Element

The `<kbd>` element defines keyboard input, displaying content in the browser's default monospace font.

Example:
```html
<p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p>
```

### `<samp>` Element

The `<samp>` element represents sample output from a computer program, displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

Example:
```html
<p>Message from my computer:</p>
<p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p>
```

### `<var>` Element

The `<var>` element defines a variable in programming or a mathematical expression. It typically displays content in italics.

Example:
```html
<p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p>
```

## Additional Notes

- The `<pre>` element can be used in conjunction with `<code>` to preserve whitespace and line breaks in code snippets.
- These elements are essential for accurately representing code and its various components within HTML documents.
