# HTML Comments
HTML comments are a way to add annotations and document your HTML source code without displaying them in the browser.
## HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
```html
<!-- Write your comments here -->
```

Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

**Note:** Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

## Usage of Comments

Comments in HTML can serve various purposes:

- **Documentation:** Add notifications and reminders in your HTML code.
- **Hiding Content:** Comments can be used to hide content temporarily or debug HTML code.
- **Hiding Inline Content:** Comments can also hide parts within HTML elements.

### Examples

- **Hide Content:**

```html
<!-- <p>This is another paragraph </p> -->
```

- **Hide Inline Content:**

```html
<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
```
